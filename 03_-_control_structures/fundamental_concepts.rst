 Chapter 3: Control Structures
*******************************



Fundamental Concepts
====================


3.1 What Is a Control Structure?
--------------------------------
* Control flow is the order that instructions in are executed in a program.
* A control statement is a statement that determines the control flow of a set
  of instructions. 
* A control structure is a set of instructions and the control statements
  controlling their execution.
* The Python language reference categorizes these as compound statements.
* Three fundamental forms of control in programming are sequential, selection,
  and iterative control.


3.2 Boolean Expressions (Conditions)
------------------------------------
* The Boolean data type contains two Boolean values, denoted as True and False
  in Python.
* A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value.


3.2.1 Relational Operators
--------------------------
* The relational operators ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=`` can be
  applied to any set of values that has an ordering.
* Strings are compared based on the lexographical odering of their member
  characters, which is derived from the characters respective values (unicode
  code points).


3.2.2 Membership Operators
--------------------------
* Python provides membership operators ``in`` and ``not it`` for determining if
  a  specific value is in (or not in) a given list of values (or any
  collection, really).
