# All That Talking
# Develop and test a Python program that determines how much time it would take
# to download all instances of every word ever spoken. Assume the size of this
# information as given in Figure 2-1.
#
# The download speed is to be entered by the user in million of bits per second
# (mbps). (One of the only units not in the chart!) To find your actual
# connection speed, go to the following website (from Intel Corporation) or
# similar site,
#
# www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gamers/broadband-speed-test.html Because
#
# Connection speeds can vary, so run this connection speed test three times.
# Take the average of three results, and use that as the connection speed to
# enter into your program. Finally, determine what unit of time is best to
# express your results. Minutes, hours, days, other?
