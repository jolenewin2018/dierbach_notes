 Questions
***********
* Is there a more readable algorithm for calculating the day of the year from a given date?
    * `Zellers Congruence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller's_congruence>`_
       seems promising. There is also a wikipedia article that lists `various other algorithms
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determination_of_the_day_of_the_week>`_.
* How could I come up with my own algorithm for determining the day of given any date?
* What is the gregorian calendar based on, anyways?
* What is the most efficient algorithm for solving the travelling salesman problem?
* What is are state diagrams, decision trees, and graph theory?
* What are some things I've learned from this chaapter as a side effect of
  reasoning about the problems?
    * I have to set extremely small, specific, and acheivable goals; then
      enjoy the little victories each time I acheive one. Otherwise, it
      easy to become discouraged.
    * As a solution become more general it tends to becomes both more useful
      (because it can be applied to more situations), and more complex (because
      edge cases must be accounted for).
    * Two techniques to avoid wasting time thinking about details not relevant
      to the problem unnecessarily are:
        * Abstract as much as possible. Look for symmetry.
        * Make the problem harder by adding more constraints to the solution.
        * The tendency to think of things as a game is a healthy one in the
          context of writing algorithms or reasoning abstractly. Can you tell
          that thinking too concretely has bit me before?
