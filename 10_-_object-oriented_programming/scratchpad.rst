* Scala combines OOP and functional programming paradigm features - it has both
  classes and first class functions. I *think* functions are referentially
  transparent. Is it declarative? Do some more reading about it.
* What is the difference between a static and dynamic method?
* What is the difference between a class and instance variable? (Ok, I know
  this one already.)
* How do you create a static method?
  ::
    @staticmethod
    def method_name(parameters):
        suite

* Ok, what about the `self` identifier? Why do you have to explicitly type it
  in for each variable in a constructor method, like __init__?
